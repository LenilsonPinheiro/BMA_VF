I have made the necessary changes to fix the CSRF error. To test the changes, you need to run the `run.bat` script. This script will reset the development database, install the necessary dependencies, and start the development server. You can run it by executing `.\run.bat` in your terminal. After running the script, you can access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` and test the form submission.
